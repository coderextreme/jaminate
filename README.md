# jaminate


For JaminateBridge (Java Program)
Load files as .html
Save files as .html
Load propriety format as .txt

More inforamation on the type of HTML later.  I will create some examples

See below for information on taking the proprietary format to generate VRML Event chaining code
In: ./Jaminate/app/src/main/javascript

John.json -- Provide JSON data here.
John.txt -- Input file in proprietary format
takes.John.timers.txt -- Sample time sensors
takes.John.txt -- generated event chaining codE
takes.js -- takes John.json and produces takes.John.timer.txt and takes.John.txt

Later, I may provide Perl code to produce John.json from John.txt. Not all that information is needed for takes.js anymore.
